#Info
This is a side project-thing. We don't really know what's going to happen for most of the time.
This is a project between Christian (milessname) and me, dylangernert (Dylan). I hope that this actually works out. We may spend a lot of time on it. 

This readme file will be full of updates, so stay tuned!
